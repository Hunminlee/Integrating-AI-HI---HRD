# Integrating Cross-Human Intelligence and Artificial Intelligence: Through Case Study in Organizational Management

This repository contains the code and datasets associated with the paper "Integrating Cross-Human Intelligence and Artificial Intelligence: Through Case Study in Organizational Management." 

AI is revolutionizing HRD, traditionally managed by professionals. The integration of AI-powered tools in both industry and academia marks a significant shift. While AI enhances efficiency in tasks like training and development, its black-box nature poses challenges, particularly in transparency and trust. Our work addresses the gap between human expertise and AI in HRD by analyzing and interpreting advanced models on HRD tasks. Our findings highlight the importance of aligning AI decisions with expert knowledge, improving the transparency and reliability of AI in HRD.

## Repository Structure

- `Data Analysis/`: Contains the data preprocessing schemes used to understand the data and to train the AI model.
- `Deep Learning/`: Includes the deep learning models and its training / testing process.
- `GBMs/`: Includes processes for exploratory data analysis, feature extraction, and machine learning-based model evaluation (i.e., XGBoost, LightGBM, Catboost, etc.).
- `Images/`: Includes figures used in our manuscript 

* Please note that the code is runnable in Jupyter notebooks and the output results are directly posted.
